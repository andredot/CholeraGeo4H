```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Preliminary steps

The project is written according to the LAIMS analysis template, thus most of the objects can be retrieved through Quarto.

Also, relevant libraries are loaded

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ycc <- tar_read(ycc)
```

Data should be grouped by the Epi-Week where they have been recorded.



## General description of the Epidemics

The dataset contains the description of Cholera cases in Yemen from 22nd May 2017 to 18th February 2018, with no missing data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ycc |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = cases)) +
  facet_wrap(~govt)
```

Focusing on a single district, the new cases can be visualised.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ycc |>
  filter(govt == "Dhamar") |>
  mutate(new_cases = cases - lag(cases)) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = new_cases))
```
