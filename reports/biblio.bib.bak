	abstract = {The global burden of cholera is largely unknown because the majority of cases are not reported. The low reporting can be attributed to limited capacity of epidemiological surveillance and laboratories, as well as social, political, and economic disincentives for reporting. We previously estimated 2.8 million cases and 91,000 deaths annually due to cholera in 51 endemic countries. A major limitation in our previous estimate was that the endemic and non-endemic countries were defined based on the countries’ reported cholera cases. If a country did not report cases even though the country had cholera, the country was classified as cholera free. This time we addressed this limitation by using a spatial modelling technique, which helped us define the cholera-endemic countries based on access to improved water and sanitation in the country as well as cholera incidence in neighboring countries. Our new estimate illustrates 2.9 million of cases and 95,000 deaths in 69 endemic countries, with the majority of the burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. The sustained high burden of cholera points to the necessity for integrated and improved control efforts, and these findings may help programmatic decision-making for controlling the disease in endemic countries.},

	abstract = {Yemen has been faced with the worst cholera epidemic of modern times, with more than 1 million suspected cases and 3000 deaths at the time of writing. This problem is largely due to the longstanding civil war between pro-government forces and the Houthi armed movement, which has severely damaged already vulnerable sanitation and healthcare facilities and systems in the country. It is further compounded by a dire lack of basic amenities, chronic malnutrition, and unfavourable weather conditions. Another contributory component may be aerial transfer by cholera-infected chironomid insects. To contain the spread of cholera in Yemen, a nation-wide armistice should be negotiated, and national and local committees must be convened to coordinate efforts on the ground. Community isolation facilities with proper sanitation, reliable disposal systems, and a clean water supply should be set up to isolate and treat sick patients. The continuity of vaccination programmes should be ensured. Public health campaigns to educate local communities about good hygiene practices and nutrition are also necessary. The One Health paradigm emphasizes a multi-sectoral and transdisciplinary understanding and approach to prevent and mitigate the threat of communicable diseases. This paradigm is highly applicable to the ongoing cholera crisis in Yemen, as it demands a holistic and whole-of-society approach at the local, regional, and national levels. The key stakeholders and warring parties in Yemen must work towards a lasting ceasefire during these trying times, especially given the extra burden from the mounting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak worldwide.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
In Yemen, the largest cholera epidemic of modern times started in late 2016. By March 2018, more than one million cases had been reported. A national electronic Disease Early Warning System (eDEWS) for infectious disease surveillance was established in 2013.

Aim:
This study assessed the eDEWS’s timelines for reported cholera cases.

Methods:
Quantitative data published in eDEWS and the Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin of the Yemen Ministry of Health from March 2013 until March 2018 were analyzed. For assessing the early detection of cholera cases, 262 weekly bulletins were reviewed. The raw data of the immediately generated eDEWS alerts during the first outbreak wave were used to assess response timeliness.

Results:
Reported cholera incidence peaked at 1,698 cases (first wave) in 2016 week 49, and then reached 46,667 cases (second wave) in 2017 week 26. The mean time period between reporting and the first response was 2.85 days. Only 31\% of the eDEWS alerts were verified within the first 24 hours, and the majority (83\%) were verified within one week. There were major differences in the timeliness between the governorates, ranging from 8\%-62\% for reporting within the first 24 hours.

Conclusion:
The eDEWS is able to detect and alert health authorities about cholera cases even under conditions of ongoing war and civil war, however, the timeliness of the response needs improvement.},

            BUGS is a software package for Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling. The software has been instrumental in raising awareness of Bayesian modelling among both academic and commercial communities internationally, and has enjoyed considerable success over its 20‐year life span. Despite this, the software has a number of shortcomings and a principal aim of this paper is to provide a balanced critical appraisal, in particular highlighting how various ideas have led to unprecedented flexibility while at the same time producing negative side effects. We also present a historical overview of the BUGS project and some future perspectives. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
